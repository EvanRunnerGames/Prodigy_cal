Free and Open Source Calculator
Introduction
Welcome to our project! This is not your ordinary calculator. Designed to make math homework easier, this tool is perfect for when you have certain measurements (like area, radius, diameter, or circumference) and need to find the unknowns. Simply input what you have, and let the calculator find what you're missing.

Features
Ease of Use: Just input the measurements you have, and the calculator does the rest.
Supports Various Measurements: Works with area, radius, diameter, and circumference.
Open Source: Feel free to contribute or fork this project to make it even better!
How to Use
Start the calculator.
Input the measurement you have (e.g., area, radius, diameter, circumference).
Enter the numerical value of your input.
The calculator will compute and provide the unknown measurements.
We also have other calculator options such as Normal Calculator and "Algebra that does Algebra that finds x or any other unknow value" - THE TEXT IN QUOTES IS COMING SOON

Installation:
Just dowload the main.exe file and double click it then your in the calculator it will open in a terminal/command line window

?If it did not let you dowload then go to dowloads ----> 3 DOTS -----> KEEP -----> SHOW MORE -------> KEEP ANYWAY
?The reason your computer thinks this file might be unsafe is because it is written in python and you computer says wait this file is not commonly dowloaded, #the reason for this is because this is a small project and not really anybody has dowloaded it so it is not really know
